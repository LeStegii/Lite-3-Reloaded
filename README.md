<summary>English description</summary>

**Lite 3 Reloaded** is a 1.12.2 version of the 1.7.10 FTB Lite 3 Pack by Feed The Beast. It contains nearly all mods (or replacements) that were in the original pack. It is very lightweigth and should be playable on basically every computer. Because there aren't that many mods in the pack, it is also perfect for people who just started with modpacks and want to learn something about mods.

It's recommend to use [**Optifine**](https://optifine.net/adloadx?f=OptiFine_1.12.2_HD_U_G5.jar) in order to have a better performance.
